Hi, if you're a student at FII and you're looking for some guidance 
for lab/project tasks, search no more because it's all here.


**I advise you to do your own research and to try completing the tasks by yourself before looking up the solution. It's not really hard and the Microsoft documentation is actually quite good and answers 99% of the questions you might have while working with winapi.**

The official documentation can be found here: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/

> You can navigate the documentation faster by doing a quick google search with the name of the function. A link to the official documentation should be one of the first results.
